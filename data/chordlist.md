# Chord List

## Fingers

| Num. | Finger                                |
|------|---------------------------------------|
| x    | Do not play                           |
| 0    | Open string (play without any finger) |
| 1    | Index finger                          |
| 2    | Middle finger                         |
| 3    | Ring finger                           |
| 4    | Little finger                         |

- Fingers are typically listed `E,A,D,G,B,e`. These are the values of `s`.
- `s:X` means string `s` is not played.
- `s:0` means string `s` is played openly (no finger).
- `f:n` means hold finger `f` at the `n` index value (see [Fret Chart](fretchart.md) for index numbers.)
- `f:a-b` means use finger `f` to **BARRE** index values `a` through `b`. These strings should be played

## Chords

Note:

- Using "dim" instead of superscript "0" to indicate "diminished" chord, since I can't type superscript.
- Using "aug" instead of "+" to indicate "augmented" chord for clarity
