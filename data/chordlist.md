# Chord List

## Fingers

| Num. | Finger                                |
|------|---------------------------------------|
| x    | Do not play                           |
| 0    | Open string (play without any finger) |
| 1    | Index finger                          |
| 2    | Middle finger                         |
| 3    | Ring finger                           |
| 4    | Little finger                         |

- Fingers are typically listed `E,A,D,G,B,e`. These are the values of `s`.
- `s:X` means string `s` is not played.
- `s:0` means string `s` is played openly (no finger).
- `f:n` means hold finger `f` at the `n` index value (see [Fret Chart](fretchart.md) for index numbers.)
- `f:a-b` means use finger `f` to **BARRE** index values `a` through `b`. These strings should be played

## Notes

- A **note** is the representation of a musica sound. Notes can represent the *pitch* and *duration* of a sound in musical notation. A note can also represent a *pitch class*.
- A **pitch** is a perceptual property of sounds that allows their ordering of a frequency-related scale, or more commonly, it is the quality that makes it possible to judge sounds as "higher" and "lower" in the sense associated with musical melodies.  Pitch is closely related to frequency but are not equivalent. Pitch is a subjective psychoacoustical attribute of sound, whereas frequency is an objective scientific attribute that can be measured. Pitch is each person's *subjective perception* of a sound wave, which cannot be directly measured. However, this doesn't necessarily mean that most people won't agree on which notes are higher and lower.
- A **pitch class** (or p.c.) is a set of all pitches that are a whole number of octaves apart.
- An **interval** is a difference in pitch between two sounds. An interval may be described as *horizontal*, *linear*, or *melodic* if it refers to successively sounding tones, such as two adjacent pitches in a melody, and *vertical* or *harmonic* if it pertains to simultaneously soundin gtones, such as in a chord.
- A **chord** is any harmonic set of pitches/frequencies consisting of multiple notes that are heard as if sounding simultaneously.
- A **semitone** (also called a *half step* or *half tone*) is the smalles musica inerval commonly used in Western tonal music, and it is considered the most dissonant when sounded harmonically. It is defined as the interval between two adjacent notes in a 12-tone scale.
- The three basic **accidentals** are **flats**, **naturals**, and **sharps**.
- A Natural (which might be denoted as nN or Nn, where N is a note value) cancels out any flat or sharp.
- A Flat (which will be written as (bN or Nb), means lower in pitch by one semitone.
- A Sharp (which will be written as (#N or N#), means higher in pitch by one semitone.
- Flats and Sharps will be written as "b" and "#", respectively.
- "Nx" (where N is a note value) represents the double sharp, which is written ether as "##" or a fancy looking "x". We'll just use regular "x" in the spelling.
- On a musical keyboard, the white keys are sometimes called "naturals" and the black keys are called "accidentals" (or sharps or flats).
- Bb chords are the same as A# chords.
- C# chords are the same as Db chords.
- Eb chords are the same as D# chords.
- F# chords are the same as Gb chords.
- Ab chords are the same as G# chords.
- TODO: is Abb the same as G? (I'm pretty sure it is.)
   - Sort of. Double flats (bb) indicate a note is lower by two semitones or a whole step.
   - There's also a triple flat (bbb) which lowers a note by three semintones, or a whole step and a semitone.
   - In Persian music, there is something called "koron" which means "less than lower in pitch" which is equivalent to one-half a flat, or one-quarter lower of a step.
- TODO: is Fx the same as G?
   - Sort of. Double sharps (##) dincate a note is higher by two semitones or a whole step.
   - Similar to the koron, Persian music also has "sori" which is equivalent to one-half a sharp, or one-quarter higher of a step.
- We won't have any korons or soris in this list. Although I might add them if requested.
- Using "dim" instead of superscript "0" to indicate "diminished" chord, since I can't type superscript.
- Using "aug" instead of "+" to indicate "augmented" chord for clarity
- The first book I borrowed with most of these chords in it has A LOT of typos in it. Which is why I want to do some proofreading and use more than one source to check the verasity of the data.
- NOTE TO SELF: Do not move these notes outside of this document. Do a raw table later and also a list of split tables later.
- There's a pattern in many of these chords. I should consider changing the order of what is listed later as many of the chords could simply be altered by adjusting the key in which they are in. This could be used to produce a list of formulas which could shorten this list, possibly by 92%. For now, let's list everything.
