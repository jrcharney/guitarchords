# How to add a record

1. Copy the temp.txt file
2. Fill out the information on top.
3. Modify string values if you are playing in a different key (e.g. playing Drop D on the E string? Change E to D on the left hand side.)
4. Modify the fret numbers on top if you are playing lower than the first fret. The first number should always be 0 for open strings. Values should be consecutive, but 0 doesn't have to be.  See notes below for what to do if you need to go highter than the 9th fret.
5. Add finger numbers (See "Fingers" below) Match the finger with the string and fret like a grid.

## Notes

- One chord per record. If you have a different position for a chord, create another record.
- We use the "fingered fret" method to show what fingers are used in a chord.
- You can change the fret number on the top to different fret numbers so as long as they are consecutive and the first number is 0 for open strings.
- If you need to use a number larger than 9, consider using letters for frets above the 10th fret (A, B, C, D, etc.)
- Strings that should not be play should have no finger number on them.
- Barre chords (where you use a single finger to hold down more than one string) will have consecutive number values below each other. 

## Fingers

| Num. | Finger                |
|------|-----------------------|
| 0    | None (open string)    |
| 1    | Index                 |
| 2    | Middle                |
| 3    | Ring                  |
| 4    | Little (a.k.a. pinky) |

Avoid using your thumb! Guitars typically are NOT played with your thumb. Thumbs should only be used to support the neck with the palm of your hand.
